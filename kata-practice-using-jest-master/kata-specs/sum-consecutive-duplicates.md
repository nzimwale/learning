```javascript
    sumConsecutiveDuplicates([1,2,3]]);
    // -> [1,2,3]
```

```javascript
sumConsecutiveDuplicates([1, 1, 2, 3]);
// -> [2,2,3]
```

```javascript
sumConsecutiveDuplicates([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]);
// -> [2,4,6]
```

```javascript
sumConsecutiveDuplicates([1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]);
// -> [2,2,4,2,3]
