      <h2>A positive impact</h2>
        <p>Solskjær must surely be in with a shot at the role full-time after his fast start to life as the boss at Old Trafford.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A 100% win-rate from his first 8 games in charge is the best start of any Manchester United Manager ever.</li>
          <li>It's also the most successful start to a Premier League manager job, surpassing Pep Guardiola.</li>
          <li>Restoring a fast, dynamic system the team find themselves full of goals at the moment.</li>
          <li>Pogba in particular is rejuvinated, with 4 goals and 4 assists so far under Solskjær.</li>
          <li>The fans say he's "made football fun again".</li>
